# 🛡️ Privacy Policy for *Dyslexic Reader*

**Last updated: July 10, 2025**

## Overview
*Dyslexic Reader* is a Chrome extension that enhances web readability by replacing default fonts on web pages with the [OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org) font. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to maintaining a transparent and secure experience.

---

## 🔍 What Data We Collect
We **do not collect**, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data.

The extension:
- Does **not** access or transmit browsing history
- Does **not** track or monitor user activity
- Does **not** send any data to external servers (except for loading the font from a public CDN)

---

## 📦 What the Extension Does
The extension:
- Loads the OpenDyslexic font from a secure third-party CDN (`fonts.cdnfonts.com`)
- Applies this font to visible text elements on the websites you visit
- Observes changes to the page content (e.g. dynamic content loads) to apply the font consistently
- Stores a single local setting (`enabled`) using `chrome.storage.local` to determine whether the font replacement is active

No cookies, analytics, or hidden tracking mechanisms are used.

---

## 🌐 Third-Party Services
We use one third-party service:

- **fonts.cdnfonts.com** – to load the OpenDyslexic font file (WOFF format)

This service may receive standard HTTP requests from your browser when the font is loaded. Refer to their [privacy policy](https://www.cdnfonts.com/privacy-policy) for more details.

---

## 🔒 Local Storage
We use Chrome's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to store the user's preference (whether font replacement is enabled). This data is:
- Stored **only on your device**
- Not synced or transmitted elsewhere
- Used solely to determine if the extension should modify fonts on web pages

---

## 👤 User Consent
By installing and using this extension, you consent to the functionality described above.
