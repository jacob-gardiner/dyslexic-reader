# Dyslexic Reader

This is a simple Chrome extension that replaces all web fonts with the Open Dyslexic font.

[Open Dyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org/) is a typeface designed to make reading easier for those who suffer from dyslexia. The weighted bottoms and unique shapes of each letter have been shown to help individuals with dyslexia differentiate better between letters, and reduce rotation, flipping, and swapping.
